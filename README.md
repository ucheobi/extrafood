Extraordinary food is an online restaurant demo. The aim is to create a full-stack codebase that covers the client's ordering section and the admin section that helps take and manage orders. It covers the frontend, backend, database, and API. I have learned some new technologies that I've not worked with but created some very basic stuff. Therefore, in this project, I try to put a lot together to build a robust and complex project. I am very excited about this project!

At the end of this project, my intention is to create a Youtube video that will show the steps and challenges I faced creating this complex project.

Main PAGES
=====
1. HomePage - This is the first page that contains the listing for different menus and allows users to create a simple account.

NB: Most of the pages are created with modals since there are not many details.

2. Single food description - Just like the name, it is a description for a specific menu and related menu categories.
3. User Profile - Contains the details for a user, like personal details, contacts, address, and payments methods.
4. Order Fulfillment Page - It contains the customer's orders and details of the orders.
5. Admin Dashboard - This is the page that the admin will use to manage orders, create a new menu, add new employees that help in fulfilling orders, view sales, and more.

+++These are the ones I have envisioned based on my current requirements, others may come as the project grows+++


TECHNOLOGIES
============
+  React - React has been my favorite framework and it's still my preferred framework till date. It's very easy to build and easily composable with all the flexibility to use with other technologies.
+ TypeScript - I've been programming with JavaScript for a long time and learned TypeScriipt. So far I've only done things done some basic stuff with TypeScript therefore this project allows me to explore different possibilities with the language and learn more.
+ TailwindCSS - This is a very cool CSS framework, and with the combination of Styled-components, it can only get better.!!!
+ Styled-component - I've done CSS stylesheets, Advance CSS, Bootstrap and even tried a few frameworks like SASS. I've never seen such an amazing framework like styled-component. With React being a component-based framework, styled-components just make react so much easily portable. CSS has always been a pain in my as* but with styled-components - I'm just having fun!
+ Nest.js - So far I've mostly used Node.js/Express.js as my backend working with REST API. I just discovered this new guy and I'm so loving it! The power, flexibility, decorators everywhere and how it supports GraphQL, TypeORM, and multiple databases, I just love it.
+ Apollo GraphQL -  Ok, now it's getting more interesting! While REST API has been for a while, GraphQL has just made querying data so much easy and fun working with. There is no longer a need to create new code for new endpoints!
+ TypeORM - This is also an amazing Object Relation Mapper that supports, multiple databases and makes the TypeScript seamless. It adds loads of functionalities and definitely a good choice for me.
+ MySQL - Not much to say here as TypeORM helps do the heavy lifting behind the scene through entities and migration support.
+ Redux! (why not?) - Well, I've not yet made up my mind whether to use Redux or not. I will only use this if it's absolutely necessary as the code is getting more complex to manage and the component drilling is getting more confusing (-_-). For now, i'm working with ContextAPI and it serves my need.
+ Other (more technologies may still show up along the way.
